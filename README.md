## Project 2: Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier

### Overview
This project demostrates usage of deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. The project uses Convolutional Neural Network architecture [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf)  as a starting point for develpoping a model to be trained and validated so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

The project includes following procedures:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

A detail witeup of the projects can be found in [CarND_writeup_P2.md](CarND_writeup_P2.md) document.

### Project Environment

The project environment was created with [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit). The model was executed, trained and tested on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) GPU-enabled Linux instance.
